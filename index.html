        [Intro]
Baby, I love you to the moon and back

[Verse 1]
Stars, talkin' like Mufasa
Know you got some scars but I promise that I got you
Stars, singin' like Sinatra
Fly me to the moon, there ain't nothin' that could stop you

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, my thoughts get dark but you shine so bright
Yeah, you shine so bright
You got me singin' out every night

[Chorus]
Baby, I love you to the moon and back
Baby, I love you to the moon and back
Ain't nobody above you
See the stars in the sky when I look in your eyes
I'm on the moon and back
Baby, I love you to theâ€”

[Verse 2]
Stars, makin' conversation
You connect the dots to my heart, constellation
Car, somethin' like a spaceship
Look up at the roof, see the stars, yeah, we made it
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, my thoughts get dark but you shine so bright
Yeah, you shine so bright
You got me singin' out every night

[Chorus]
Baby, I love you to the moon and back
Baby, I love you to the moon and back
Ain't nobody above you
See the stars in the sky when I look in your eyes
I'm on the moon and back
Baby, I love you

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I could spend every night, starin' at you, baby
See the stars in your eyes, you know how to phase me
Like the moon, you control the tides, yeah, you wavy
Malibu, with you every night, goin' crazy
I could be the one for you, don't need your sign
You could be my better side, no Gemini
And every time I touch you, I touch the sky

[Chorus]
Baby, I love you to the moon and back
Baby, I love you to the moon and back (Baby, I love you to the moon)
Ain't nobody above you
See the stars in the sky when I look in your eyes
I'm on the moon and back
